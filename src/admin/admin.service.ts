   * When running inside Docker (with `restart: always` or similar),
   * the container will **not automatically restart** after a graceful shutdown.
   * Use {@link restart} if you want to trigger a container restart instead.

   *   -H "x-api-key: super-secret-key"
   * ```

   * The restart logic does **not** manually spawn a new Node.js process,
   * avoiding port conflicts and ensuring consistent runtime state.
